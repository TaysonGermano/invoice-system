## My process

Since I knew I had to use react for this project, the first step was to understand all the requirements clearly and see what components will need to be created.
For this project I choose to go for JSS as the style option simple because I felt like is a big front end project and I needed SASS for style.
Since I had to create two forms one to create the invoices and another one to edit invoices, had to use a form hook like react form hook or formik and for this one project I went for Formik
